# dotfiles

First, download this repository and save it in ~/.dotfiles.

Make sure to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then you can install the dotfiles via the install script.

```bash
/bin/bash ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

Or you can install the dotfiles via the install script from the web. (work-in-progress, aka very much not working)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peter-512/.dotfiles/main/install.sh)"
```
